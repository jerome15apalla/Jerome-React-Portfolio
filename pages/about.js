                I am a BS Computer Science student currently on my 3rd Year
                and i am aspiring to enter the industry of programming and software development.
                I want to learn and experience new things as much as possible to expand my
                knowledge more and more and to be able to keep up with the current trend of technology.

                What i really love about programming in general is because it does not limit you
                on how you want to do things and on what you want to create and because it also
                allows me to discover, explore and figure out new solutions just like what
                Chris Pine have said.
